      I am building going by the object selection route. while trying to use my
      experience to the best of my ability. i am freehanding a lot of the
      solutions from both lessons thought in the course and previous experience
      with openGL. <br />

      I will be starting with the worksheet10p4 as it already contained some
      nice implementation for viewing the objects from all sides and distances
      but with some modifications to be able to display multiple objects. I'm
      then writing a pathtracer to generate a ray traveling through the camera
      frustum and checking for hits with triangles in the objects. if found it
      checks if it was closer than already found since the user expects to
      "touch" the first object it sees when pressing the screen instead of
      something further back. I've also chosen to change the color of the object
      hit to give a clear indication for what has been selected to the user.
      <br />

      The solution uses the event handler to collect the users button press
      which is translated into screencoordinates onto the nearplane. by
      mulipling this coordinate with inverse projection and view matrices we get
      it from view/frustum space into worldspace coordinates. we can then use
      this to draw a line between the camera point and the screencoord on
      frustum to get the direction the ray will travel.<br />

      with they ray origin (camera location) and ray direction we can simply
      loop over all triangles to check for intersections. successful hits will
      trigger a check if it's closer and if it is we save the index of the
      object that was detected. <br />

      The result is decent but there is an issue where if you press below an
      object you will often still hit it and i am unsure why. There is also no
      optimisation done meaning that you have to go through all triangles every
      time. which could take time if you are working with massive sets of
      objects with many verticies. If i were to continue with this i would add a
      BSP tree structure to divide the triangles into searchable arrays. but i
      felt that this was unnessesary for the scope of this project. as it
      already took much longer than expected.<br />

      If I were to continue with this i would have also added ways to drag
      around the objects in the 3d space to place them since now they're just
      stuck inside eachother.</a
