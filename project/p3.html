      For my project, I started with the object selection example, borrowing
      much of the code from the examples provided. However, I also included
      pieces from my own worksheets and added some new functionality to make it
      my own. <br />
      I decided to begin with the code from worksheet10p4 because it already had
      most of what I needed to show an object from different sides and
      distances. But I simplified it quite a bit since I didn’t see much point
      in including panning or having multiple buttons for this project. The
      object selection method I used in parts 2 and 3 is based on rendering the
      scene in specific colors and reading the pixel color value under the
      cursor. It’s a simple but effective way to implement selection. <br />
      Part 2: In part 2, we implemented basic object selection by drawing the
      cube in a solid red color during a hidden render pass. The red value (R)
      of the pixel under the cursor is checked, and if it’s 255, we know the
      cube was selected. To avoid flashing the user with a bright red cube, this
      "hidden" draw call is never actually displayed—it's overridden by a normal
      draw in the same frame. If the selection is successful, we just alert the
      user that the object was selected.<br />
      Part 3: In part 3, I extended this to select individual sides of the cube.
      Instead of rendering the whole cube red, I rendered each face using its
      face index as the alpha channel value during a hidden render pass. By
      reading the alpha value under the cursor, the program can figure out which
      face was clicked. Once a face is selected, we change its color to white so
      the user can see which side was picked. This makes the selection process
      clear and intuitive.<br />
      This method works well and is computationally simple. By using hidden
      renders and per-pixel color detection, it avoids more complex techniques
      like ray casting or scene traversal, while still being accurate and
      efficient.<br />
      some downsides of this approach is that it relies hevily on hidden
      rendering passes which may not integrate simply into more complex
      rendering pipelines or scenes. making it less flexible than other options.
      It could also might not scale well for more complex objects or more
      complex shaders. And while this was not the inteded use case in this
      project for programs where you want to select all objects in a line even
      if hidden behind other objects such as shooting games this cannot identify
      objects behind the first one.<br />
